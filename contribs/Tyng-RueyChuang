MY FRIEND IS NOT FREE by Tyng-Ruey Chuang

Most of the time it came down to emotion. It was anger, frustration, exhaustion, feeling alone, confusion, and wanting to escape it all. You wished there would be hope. But it was hopeless. It was endless. It didn't get through. You were talking the same thing over again. You were back to face the same wall. You talked to many people: new people, different people, the same people. They didn't understand! You were looping in angst. There was no way to stop.

You were there. You have been there. You are standing here but you are still there as the emotion is here is there is everywhere.

Getting to freedom is not free. My friend it is not free. MY FRIEND IS NOT FREE.
